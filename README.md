+ **Project summary**:
+ As the vaccination for covid-19 first introduced in Jan 2021 to the public, vaccinations become one of the most popular discussions of the pandemic. We would like to explore some insights of the vaccination data to see the relations between the pandemic and the introduction of vaccinations. We discussed the topic from the timeseries of global total vaccinations, confirmed cases and death cases by countries, a map to explore the cases and vaccinations allover the world, a timeseries of the vaccination by different pharmmaceutical industries and an analysis part of the global utilization of vacciations and the distribution of vaccinations in US.
